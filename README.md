#FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Projects

##Mario Landing Page

This project was made for the "Product Landing Page" project to obtain FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. It was supposed to be about a product but I thought it would be more fun to do it about Mario, either way it fulfills all the user stories and passes all the tests established by FreeCodeCamp.
